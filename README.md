# 👋 Hello! I'm Carlos Frinka Neto

I'm a Fullstack Developer with over 5 years of experience building robust, scalable web applications. I specialize in creating clean, responsive, and performant interfaces using modern frameworks like React, Next.js, and Vue.js, and building powerful backend services with Node.js, TypeScript, and AWS Lambda.

I've worked on international projects across Brazil and the U.S., contributing to systems used in major events like the Superbowl and by global brands like Disney. I'm passionate about clean code, system optimization, and building products that users love.
